You step off the path onto what looks like a dock made out of popsicle sticks.  
As far as the eye can see out over the horizon, you can see an ice cream sea, 
with its waves crashing against the cliff on the visible shore to the north and 
south but wait, is that a yellow square in the distance?  To the east is the 
sea, but you'll need a boat (good thing you brought it along).  Back to the 
west is the path.

The Spiral Tower~
As you step around the corner, you see the end of the hall.  It looks like the
walls are changing in front of you...taking a more terrifying shape.  The hall 
continues east.

In Front of the Hallway~
As you walk foreward, you notice that the walls HAVE been changing.  They have 
taken the form of Gloppy, but he seems different this time...more awesome than 
before.  The door is south.

Before the Throne Room~
You are standing before the throne room of King Kandy.  The room is very richly
decorated with gemstones.  As you look closely at these gemstones, you notice 
something strange...they are actually rock candy.  The throne room is west.

The Throne Room~
You are standing in the throne room.  This is the final step in your quest for 
the power behind everything in Candyland.  Everything in this room is made of 
sugar.  You can feel your teeth rotting just from being in this room.  There is 
a door up.
